The test run successfully. I used cucumber with selenium3 to accomplish the task. I also used gradle as a build tool. There are some new concepts for me and it took some time to get myself around. For the same reason, the test lacks of good practices as page object classes.

I have tested the scenario only in firefox(v53) on a Linux machine. I include the geckodriver that I used for this test. I dont own a Windows machine to testagainst but this should not be a problem if you run FF, but I could not test IE for this reason. I was uncertain whether I have to use headless browser or not. In such a case I could use phantomjs.

Another thing that makes me struggle with, was the advert popups which I try to disable with a various ways that they did not seem to work. The site set the AdvertCookie to True when you close the popup the first time and I was expecting that doing that manually I would get rid of the popups afterwards. But this, as i said, didnt work. Thus the actions go step by step to add the two items in the bag, instead to be in a for loop, as it would be more proper.
